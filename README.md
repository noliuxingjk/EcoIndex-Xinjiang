# EcoIndex-Xinjiang

A reproducible workflow for eco-hydrological index calculation, spatiotemporal trend detection, and driver attribution across Xinjiang from 2000 to 2023. This repository implements a full pipeline for preprocessing remote sensing datasets, computing ecological indicators (e.g., EcoIndex and ESI), and analyzing the dominant climate and anthropogenic drivers using machine learning methods.

| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `2_1_ecoindex.py` | Constructs a composite EcoIndex using PCA on normalized NDVI and WUE.          |
| `2_2_quadrant.py` | Classifies year-to-year NDVI‚ÄìWUE changes into 4 ecohydrological quadrants.     |
| `2_3_ESI.py`      | Calculates the Ecohydrological Similarity Index (ESI) using cosine similarity. |


### üìà 1.3_analysis/ ‚Äî Trend & Attribution Analysis
| Script                                           | Description                                                                    |
| ------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `3_1_trend_analysis_sen_mk.py`                   | Applies Sen's slope estimator and Mann‚ÄìKendall test for trend detection.       |
| `3_2_ecoindex_driver_attribution_fast.py`        | Performs pixel-wise RF regression to attribute EcoIndex variations to drivers. |
| `3_3_analyze_driver_importance_and_dominance.py` | Aggregates driver importances and visualizes climate/human dominance patterns. |

### üìê 3_2 Spatial Information
 - Projection: All rasters are reprojected to Albers Equal Area Conic for regional analysis consistency.
 - Resolution: Standardized to 0.05¬∞ (~5 km) for ecological modeling and visualization.
 - Masking: A shapefile of Xinjiang province and its three subregions (Northern, Southern, Eastern Xinjiang) is used to clip and subset all datasets.

### üì¶ 3_3 Derived Products
 - EcoIndex: Composite index reflecting vegetation productivity and water efficiency.
 - ESI (Ecohydrological Similarity Index): Cosine-based similarity measure between NDVI and WUE dynamics.
 - Trend Layers: Pixel-wise Sen's slope and Mann‚ÄìKendall p-values for change detection.
 - Driver Layers: Variable importance maps from Random Forest models (e.g., PR, TEMP, SOIL).
 - Dominance Maps: Classified maps identifying climate-, human-, or mixed-dominated regions.

üîß All intermediate files and output products are saved as GeoTIFFs and can be visualized in GIS software or Python-based mapping tools.
